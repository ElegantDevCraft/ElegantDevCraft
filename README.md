👋 Hey everyone, I’m @ElegantDevCraft

👀 I’m interested in working the video game industry and creating immersive games. My current passion project is Valoria Chronicles, a text-based RPG that I am using as a way to better my programming skills and have fun.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about Python's capabilities in game development, diving into algorithms that can create complex narratives, and possibly exploring procedural content generation to make each player's journey unique.

💞️ If anyone that has experience creating games or experience in the video game industry, I'd love to hear from you!

📫 How to reach me: Drop me a line at `sagacoder [at] gmail [dot] com` or connect with me on LinkedIn: `www [dot] linkedin [dot] com/in/nicholas-lane-9618a82b6`.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His

⚡ Fun fact: While developing Valoria Chronicles, I've become a master at making my wrists make noises that they probably shouldn't – a true programmer's skill!
